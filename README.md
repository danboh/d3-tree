# d3 Interactive Tree Diagram
Interactive d3 Tree diagram with Bootstrap Slider panel, Bootstrap Navbar, node search and highlighted path on selected node.

## Dependencies
- [Bootstrap v4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/)
- [d3 v3](https://github.com/d3/d3)

- [jQuery Slide Reveal](https://nnattawat.github.io/slideReveal/)
- [Bootstrap Select](https://developer.snapappointments.com/bootstrap-select/)

## Data
- Data is loaded directly through a json variable (js/data.js) which was needed at the moment of development. But feel free to adjust to your needs. d3 accepts other types of data loading (e.g csv).

- Data folder provides a pyhthon script to conver a CSV file into json, which is then copied to the data.js file (work in progress to automate this piece)

- The diagram was only adjusted to read 3 leves of data
